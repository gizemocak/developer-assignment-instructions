# omdb-auto-complete assignment

Points wants to build a reusable auto-complete search widget for all of its
front-end apps and is asking you to lead the development.

## Notes

* The widget should actively query the OMDB API endpoint and return search results as the user is typing.
* The user should be able to select an item from the auto-complete list. 
* Once selected the page should render the full details of the movie.

## Instructions

Use this OMDB movie search endpoint as your backend API:

    http://www.omdbapi.com/?s=love

You should include an API key in your request. An API key is
provided in the [index.html](https://github.com/Points/developer-assignments/blob/master/omdb-auto-complete/index.html#L13)
file.
